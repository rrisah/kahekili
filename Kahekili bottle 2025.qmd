# Sites

Six sites (Seep, S1-S4, Control) were sampled for nutrients and carbonate chemistry. Samples were collected (n = 6) at daytime high and low tide, and nighttime low tide for two days.

```{r}
library(here)
scripts <- list.files("Scripts", full.names = T)
source(here("Scripts", "00-library.R"))
```

# Summary plots

Boxplots of each parameter per site. Y-axis is in log-scale. Sites are arranged from the Seep to the Control site. Red circles denote mean value, grey circles denote individual data points, black circles denote outliers.

## Temperature and salinity

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Figure 2. Boxplot of temperature and salinity"
source(here("Scripts", "09-data.R"))

```

## Nutrients

```{r}
#| fig-asp: 1.236
boxplots3[[3]] + boxplots3[[4]] + boxplots3[[5]] + boxplots3[[6]]
```

## Carbonate chemistry
